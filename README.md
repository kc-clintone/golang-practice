## 🚀 Getting Started

**1. Set Up Your Go Environment**

Start by preparing your computer for Go development.  
See [setup.md](setup.md) for full, step-by-step instructions covering:

- Installing Go on Linux, macOS, or Windows
- Verifying your installation
- Setting up your workspace (`GOPATH`, environment variables)
- Recommended tools (VS Code + Go extension)
- Running a test program (`hello.go`)
- First steps in the `content/` directory
- Enabling Go modules

**Quick Start:**
```sh
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang-go

# Or with Homebrew (macOS)
brew install go
```

See the [Setup Guide](setup.md) for details.
